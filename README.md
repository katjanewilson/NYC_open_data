NYC public schools vary randomly on whether or not they have the option of a self-contained classroom for students with special needs. Matching schools on various demographic variables, I explore the effect of the self-contained class option on Attendance Rates. Employing propensity score weighting through IPTW, I create a weighted population in which the covariate distribution is balanced between treatment groups, and then later use principal stratification to explore heterogeneity in treatment effect.
